### Parametrized quasinormal modes beyond Schwarzschild and Kerr

This repository provides a python wrapper to utilize the parametrized QNM framework. 

It covers linear and quadratic QNM shifts due to modifications to the Regge-Wheeler, Zerilli and scalar perturbations around Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity.

It covers linear QNM shifts and shifts in the separation constant due to modifications to the Teukolsky perturbation equation around Kerr black holes in general relativity.

The repository is structured as follows:

  - QNM_GR (containts the general relativity values for QNMs)
  - QNM_coefficients (containts the linear/quadratic coefficients)
  - QNM_class.py (defines the QNM class that allows for a quick computation of QNMs)
  - extra_functions.py (some helper functions to load files)
  - tutorial_notebook.ipynb (a quick introduction of how to use the QNM_class)
